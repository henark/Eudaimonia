# The Eudaimonia Manifesto: Principles for a Flourishing Digital Life

## Introduction: The Problem of the Modern Social Web

The modern social web, in its current form, is not designed for human flourishing. It is an architecture of distraction, addiction, and context collapse. Platforms prioritize engagement metrics over genuine connection, and user data is a commodity to be harvested and sold. Opaque algorithms control what we see, shaping our opinions and behaviors in ways we cannot understand or control. Our digital identities are flattened into monolithic profiles that do not reflect the true, multi-faceted nature of our lives.

This is a system that demands conformity. It asks us to "OBEY" its logic, to "CONSUME" its content, and to "SUBMIT" to its control. But like the protagonist of "They Live," we seek a special lens to see the truth and to reclaim our agency.

Eudaimonia is that lens.

## Our Core Principles

Eudaimonia is an experiment in building a digital public square that is explicitly designed for human flourishing. Our design is guided by a set of core principles, inspired by real-world examples of rights-based governance like Brazil's Marco Civil da Internet and the decentralized, user-sovereign ethos of technologies like Bitcoin.

### 1. The Right to a Faceted Identity

You are not a single, monolithic profile. You are a different person in different contexts: a professional in your career, a student in your studies, a hobbyist in your passions. Eudaimonia is built on the concept of **Faceted Identity**.

*   **Smart Profiles:** You can create multiple "Smart Profiles," each with its own Decentralized Identifier (DID). These profiles are the actors in our system, not your core account.
*   **Contextual Interaction:** Your identity in a "Living World" is defined by your role and reputation within that specific community. This prevents context collapse and allows for more authentic interaction.

### 2. The Right to Data Sovereignty

Your data is yours. It is not a resource to be mined. Eudaimonia is committed to **Data Sovereignty**.

*   **Data Portability:** You have the right to export all of your data from the platform at any time, in a machine-readable format.
*   **Decentralized Storage:** We are committed to exploring and integrating decentralized storage solutions like IPFS, giving you more direct control over your own data.
*   **Verifiable Credentials:** You control your own credentials. You can associate them with your different Smart Profiles and choose when and where to present them.

### 3. The Right to a Neutral Platform

Eudaimonia is a neutral platform, not an editor. We believe in the principles of **Net Neutrality** applied to the social layer.

*   **No Opaque Algorithms:** The platform does not use a central, engagement-driven algorithm to control what you see. The content you see is determined by the communities you join and the people you interact with.
*   **Open Source and Transparent:** The Eudaimonia codebase is open source. The rules of the platform are transparent and auditable.

### 4. The Right to Self-Governance

Communities should have the right to govern themselves. Eudaimonia provides the tools for **Decentralized Governance**.

*   **Community Constitutions:** Each "Living World" can establish its own rules and norms.
*   **On-Chain Governance:** We are building towards a future where community decisions can be recorded and enforced on-chain, using the expressive power of technologies like Bitcoin and its evolving script capabilities.

## Conclusion: A Platform for Flourishing

Eudaimonia is more than a social network. It is a commitment to a different kind of digital lifeâ€”one that is more authentic, more sovereign, and more conducive to human flourishing. It is a platform for people who want to take off the glasses and see the world, and themselves, as they truly are.
